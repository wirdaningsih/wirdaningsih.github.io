<h3>Author's Corner</h3>

<p>Sir Arthur Conan Doyle is famous for his work in detective fiction. One of his famous works features Detective Sherlock Holmes as the main character. He wrote various novels and short stories featuring the detective.</p>

<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p> I have always been interested in suspense, detective stories. Moreover, Sherlock Holmes is one of my favorite fictional detective characters. I did not know what to reveal when I first chose this text. My one and only reason was because I like the series. Voyant helped me reveal some thing I did not even concern about when I read the series.
 
<h3>About this project</h3>
<p>In this project, focusing on Doyle's detective literary works with Sherlock Holmes as the main character, four novels and three collections of his short stories were analyzed with Voyant tools.</p>
<ul ul style="list-style-type:circle">
<li>1887 A Study in Scarlet (Novel)</li>
<li>1890 The Sign of the Four (Novel)</li>
<li>1892 The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes (Short stories collection)</li>
<li>1893 The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes (Short stories collection)</li>
<li>1902 The Hound of the Baskervilles (Novel)</li>
<li>1905 The Return of Sherlock Holmes (Short stories collection)</li>
<li>1905 The Valley of Fear (Novel)</li>
</ul>

<p>My first inquiry about this project was I wanted to find out the most frequent word spoken by the main character, Sherlock Holmes, in all the series. However, with Voyant I could not really specify my search with this focus. Thus, instead of focusing on the main character only, I used this tool to find out the most frequent verbs used by the author in these series. I wanted to find out the most common action perfomed in his works.</p>

<p>The figure above shows the first result of my data search. However, there are some words which are irrelevant with my focus, so I listed five words shown in the cirrus (man, sir, mr, holmes, and watson) in the stopwords tool.</p>

<p>The word 'said' appears to be most frequent verb used, which is normal as in any other fiction. The verbs 'come' and its past form 'came' become the next most frequent verbs. I think this is also quite normal as in detective stories, charactes usually come and go from one scene to another. Based on the result, I become curious about the use of the word 'think' by the author in the work. Appearing in 676 contexts, theis verb caught my eyes. To think is the most common action performed by the characters in the stories after to come and to know. Why so? I then tried to see several contexts in which 'think' occured.</p>
 
 
<iframe style='width: 958px; height: 327px;' src='//voyant-tools.org/tool/Contexts/?stopList=keywords-409ec3619032a0ec2e600b93ae275a80&query=think&corpus=7a745c69a040302ae94dc6dd6a459340'></iframe>

<p>The word 'think' mostly appears in conversation context. The author used 'think' often in this detective fiction. As the stories involve various unsolved cases, the characters need to be able to read the situation and be critical to come up with the solution. Thus, the author's choice of using the word 'think' is very relevant.</p>
<p> In order to specifically analyze the occurence of the verb 'think' in the story I chose one novel of all the series.</p>
 <iframe style='width: 637px; height: 508px;' src='//voyant-tools.org/tool/Trends/?view=Contexts&stopList=keywords-409ec3619032a0ec2e600b93ae275a80&query=think&bins=62&corpus=7a745c69a040302ae94dc6dd6a459340'></iframe>
 <p>By looking at the trend chart, it can be seen that the verb 'think' most frequently appears in the 1892 The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes short story collection. Since my purpose is to analyze the occurence in which part of the plot, I decided not to choose this collection as it comprises of several stories. Finally, I decided to choose the 1902 The Hound of Baskerville novel.</p>
<p>I separated the files based on the chapters in order to analyze the trend of the occurence of the verb 'think'.</p>
<iframe style='width: 637px; height: 508px;' src='//voyant-tools.org/tool/Trends/?query=think*&bins=17&corpus=a4645e073f39abc882decbff9e599ca7'></iframe>
<p>To my surprise, the trend result shows that in Chapter 2 no verb 'think' appears, while it reaches the peak in Chapter 13.</p>
<p>Chapter 2 is the only chapter in the novel without 'think'. I look back to the story and found out that this chapter tells the biography of Sir Charles Baskerville. In this chapter, Conan Doyle gives this background story to support the mystery development.</p>
<p>Chapter 13, on the other hand, is one most crucial part of the story. In this climax part, Holmes starts making deduction. He starts to drop clues at various points throughout the story.</p>


<p>Then, I come to wonder, what about other genres, what verbs are most frequently used? Is it 'love' for romance, or 'laugh' for comedy, or 'journey' for adventure?</p>
