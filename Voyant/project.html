<h3>Author's Corner</h3>

<p>Sir Arthur Conan Doyle is famous for his work in detective fiction. One of his famous works features Detective Sherlock Holmes as the main character. He wrote various novels and short stories featuring the detective.</p>

<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p> I have always been interested in suspense, detective stories. Moreover, Sherlock Holmes is one of my favorite fictional detective characters. I did not know what to reveal when I first chose this text. My one and only reason was because I like the series. Voyant helped me reveal some thing I did not even concern about when I read the series.
 
<h3>About this project</h3>
<p>In this project, focusing on Doyle's detective literary works with Sherlock Holmes as the main character, four novels and three collections of his short stories were analyzed with Voyant tools.</p>
<ul ul style="list-style-type:circle">
<li>1887 A Study in Scarlet (Novel)</li>
<li>1890 The Sign of the Four (Novel)</li>
<li>1892 The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes (Short stories collection)</li>
<li>1893 The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes (Short stories collection)</li>
<li>1902 The Hound of the Baskervilles (Novel)</li>
<li>1905 The Return of Sherlock Holmes (Short stories collection)</li>
<li>1905 The Valley of Fear (Novel)</li>
</ul>

<p>My first inquiry about this project was I wanted to find out the most frequent word spoken by the main character, Sherlock Holmes, in all the series. However, with Voyant I couldn't really specify my search with this focus. Thus, instead of focusing on the main character only, I used this tool to find out the most frequent verbs used by the author in these series. I wanted to find out the most common action perfomed in the works</p>

<p>The figure above shows the first result of my data search. However, there are some words which are irrelevant with my focus, so I used the stopwords tool and listed five words shown in the cirrus (man, sir, mr, holmes, and watson).</p>

<p>The word 'said' appears to be most frequent verb used, which is normal as in any other fiction. The verbs come and its past form came become the next most frequent verbs. I think this is also quite normal as in detective stories, charactes usually come and go from one scene to another. Based on the result, I become curious about the use of the word 'think' by the author in the work. Appearing in 676 contexts, theis verb caught my eyes. To think is the most common action performed by the characters in the stories after to come. Why so? I then tried to see several contexts in which 'think' occured.</p>

<p>The word think mostly appears in conversation context. Author used 'think' often in this detective fiction. To be a detective, one needs to be able to read the situation and be critical to come up with the deduction. Thus, the author's choice of using the word 'think' is very relevant.
I come to wonder, what about other genres, what verbs are most frequently used? Is it love for romance? or laugh for comedy? or quest for adventure?
