<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p>In the beginning of my inquiry on Voyant, I was really interested in finding out the most frequent word used by the main character in the story, Sherlock Holmes. However, I did not continue this analysis as I thought that it was almost impossible for me to do so considering the amount of energy needed to cut out the speech of other characters beside Holmes himself. However, it proves that it is not an impossible task. Indeed, that is the main reason why I am extending this project for my final, and focusing on this inquiry.</p>
 <p>In this extended project, I specifically narrow down my analysis on whether Sherlock Holmes really uses the verb think. In order to get the answer, I will compare two data here. First is the Voyant analysis result from The Adventure of Sherlock Holmes full version. And the second is the same series but only using Holmes’ speech, removing all others including the narration.</p>
 
 <h3>About Previous Project</h3>

<p>In the mini project, Voyant tools helped me analyze seven Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s famous detective series featuring Sherlock Holmes. My inquiry was specifically about the most frequent verb used by the author.  From the result, it was revealed that one of the most common verbs used by the author in all the series is 'think'. To better understand this result, I further my research by analyzing the occurence of the verb 'think' in one of the novels, the 1902 The Hound of Baskerville.  </p>

<p>To my surprise, the trend result shows that in Chapter 2 no verb 'think' appears, while it reaches the peak in Chapter 13.</p>

 <p>In the link visualization above, it can be seen how the verb think is connected to other words in the story. Verb think is   mostly related to a proper noun, a name of a character in the story or a place. Besides, it also shows that this verb is also related to other verbs. </p>
 
 <iframe style='width: 637px; height: 490px;' src='//voyant-tools.org/tool/WordTree/?query=think&corpus=a4645e073f39abc882decbff9e599ca7'></iframe>
 <iframe style='width: 637px; height: 490px;' src='//voyant-tools.org/tool/TermsBerry/?view=WordTree&query=think&corpus=a4645e073f39abc882decbff9e599ca7'></iframe>
 <p>In addition, the word tree map above shows the words preceeding and following 'think'. As an action verb, it is normal to see that subjects mostly appear before it. And interestingly, noun clauses using 'that' follow 'think' in many occurrences. This might show that think is used to preceed deduction made by the characters in the story. Also the term berry visualization helps show how the verb think (appears in green when we hover on it) is related to several other words (appear in pink).</p>
 
<p> The verb 'think' appears mostly in the climax part, in Chapter 13 especially. It is understandable as in this chapter Holmes starts making deduction. He starts to drop clues at various points throughout the story. By analyzing this, I developed an understanding of how Voyant helped reveal fact that most readers probably did not think of when they read a literary piece.</p>
 
 
 
<h2>About This Project</h2>
 
<p>In my previous project, I analyzed various novels and short stories written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle featuring detective Sherlock Holmes. </p>
 <iframe style='width: 637px; height: 490px;' src='//voyant-tools.org/tool/Trends/?stopList=keywords-409ec3619032a0ec2e600b93ae275a80&query=think&bins=62&corpus=7a745c69a040302ae94dc6dd6a459340'></iframe>
 <p>As shown in the trend chart above, of all the seven series, the one where the verb 'think' mostly appears is the 1892 The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes short stoty collection. Thus, I chose this collection for my further analysis </p>
 
 <p>In order to understand this collection more, the first step I took was separating the files based on the short stories included in the series.</p>
   
<ul ul style="list-style-type:circle">
<li>A Scandal in Bohemia</li>
<li>The Red-Headed league</li>
<li>A Case of Identity</li>
<li>The Boscombe Valley Mystery</li>
<li>The Five Orange Pips</li>
<li>The Man with the Twisted Lip</li>
<li>The Adventure of the Blue Carbuncle</li>
<li>The Adventure of the Speckled Band</li>
<li>The Adventure of the Engineer's Thumb</li>
<li>The Adventure of the Noble Bachelor</li>
<li>The Adventure of the Beryl Coronet</li>
<li>The Adventure of the Copper Beeches</li>
</ul>
 
 <p>My previous finding of the occurrence of verb ‘think’ leads me to new inquiry process. I want to find out whether the main protagonist in the story indeed uses this verb the most or not. To find out the answer, I compare the occurrence of this verb in two data. The first data includes the whole compilation of the short stories in The Adventure of Sherlock Holmes collection. The second data analyzed is the same collection of short story. However, I cut out the speeches of all characters except Sherlock Holmes. The data includes only Holmes’ speech, removing every other things including the speech indicators (said, answered, told, etc).</p>
 
 <h5>The Voyant Analysis result of the first data</h5>
 
 <iframe style='width: 637px; height: 508px;' src='//voyant-tools.org/tool/CorpusTerms/?corpus=2b16421cb7780127a7ab8ed18792ceaf'></iframe>
 
 <p>Using term visualization, as shown above, we can see clearly that indeed the verb 'think' is the most frequent verb used in this series, appearing 174 times. It shwos that this verb is apparently still the most favorite choice of the author to show action. 
  
  <iframe style='width: 636px; height: 508px;' src='//voyant-tools.org/tool/TermsBerry/?corpus=2b16421cb7780127a7ab8ed18792ceaf'></iframe>
  
  <p>However, the term berry visualization above surprised me. The result shows that think is mostly linked to Watson, the second lead character in the story. Based on my understanding of the story, it can mean two things. First, Holmes, the detective, always asks Watson to understand the situation of the cases. Or, because all the stories in this collection are told in first person point of view, Watson's. He narrates the whole stories, from the point of view of the detective assistant.</p>
 
 <p>Seeing this result, my curiosity grows bigger. What if of all the 174 occurences, Holmes does not use this verb that often? Then, is it Watson who uses this verb most because he is the narrator? To prove this hypothesis, it is indeed necessary to see the result from the second data.</p>
 
 <h5>The Voyant Analysis result of the second data</h5>
 
  <iframe style='width: 957px; height: 327px;' src='//voyant-tools.org/tool/Summary/?corpus=46ab2817b2f7eed93a7d0b3c9c0a0831'></iframe>
 <p>The data shows that the most frequent words used by Holmes include man, little, shall, mr, and think. Think appears 93 times in the corpus.</p>

 <p>The final result proves my first hypothesis (or rather expectation) that because 'think' shows 'mind' activity, it mostly appears at the climax of the story. And Voyant analysis proves so. What surprises me is that there is possibility that in one whole chapter, the author does not use this verb at all. All and all, voyant indeed reveals surprising facts that no readers ever expect when they read a piece of writing.</p>
