<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p>In the beginning of my inquiry on Voyant, I was really interested in finding out the most frequent word used by the main character in the story, Sherlock Holmes. However, I did not continue this analysis as I thought that it was almost impossible for me to do so considering the amount of energy needed to cut out the speech of other characters beside Holmes himself. However, it proves that it is not an impossible task. Indeed, that is the main reason why I am extending this project for my final, and focusing on this inquiry.</p>
 <p>In this extended project, I specifically narrow down my analysis on whether Sherlock Holmes really uses the verb think. In order to get the answer, I will compare two data here. First is the Voyant analysis result from The Adventure of Sherlock Holmes full version. And the second is the same series but only using Holmes’ speech, removing all others including the narration.</p>
 
 <h3>About Previous Project</h3>

<p>In the mini project, Voyant tools helped me analyze seven Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s famous detective series featuring Sherlock Holmes. My inquiry was specifically about the most frequent verb used by the author.  From the result, it was revealed that one of the most common verbs used by the author in all the series is 'think'. To better understand this result, I further my research by analyzing the occurence of the verb 'think' in one of the novels, the 1902 The Hound of Baskerville.  </p>

<p>To my surprise, the trend result shows that in Chapter 2 no verb 'think' appears, while it reaches the peak in Chapter 13.</p>

 <p>In the link visualization above, it can be seen how the verb think is connected to other words in the story. Verb think is   mostly related to a proper noun, a name of a character in the story or a place. Besides, it also shows that this verb is also related to other verbs. </p>

 <iframe style='width: 1920px; height: 915px;' src='//voyant-tools.org/tool/TermsBerry/?view=WordTree&query=think&corpus=a4645e073f39abc882decbff9e599ca7'></iframe>
 <p>In addition, the word tree map above shows the words preceeding and following 'think'. As an action verb, it is normal to see that subjects mostly appear before it. And interestingly, noun clauses using 'that' follow 'think' in many occurrences. This might show that think is used to preceed deduction made by the characters in the story. Also the term berry visualization helps show how the verb think (appears in green when we hover on it) is related to several other words (appear in pink).</p>
 
<p> The verb 'think' appears mostly in the climax part, in Chapter 13 especially. It is understandable as in this chapter Holmes starts making deduction. He starts to drop clues at various points throughout the story. By analyzing this, I developed an understanding of how Voyant helped reveal fact that most readers probably did not think of when they read a literary piece.</p>
 
 
<h3>About this project</h3>
<p>In this project, focusing on Doyle's detective literary works with Sherlock Holmes as the main character, four novels and three collections of his short stories were analyzed with Voyant tools.</p>
<ul ul style="list-style-type:circle">
<li>1887 A Study in Scarlet (Novel)</li>
<li>1890 The Sign of the Four (Novel)</li>
<li>1892 The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes (Short stories collection)</li>
<li>1893 The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes (Short stories collection)</li>
<li>1902 The Hound of the Baskervilles (Novel)</li>
<li>1905 The Return of Sherlock Holmes (Short stories collection)</li>
<li>1905 The Valley of Fear (Novel)</li>
</ul>


 


 
 
 <p>think in all the adventure of sherlock holmes series. 174 times. how many exactly holmes uses this verb?</p>

 <p> all holmes only</p>

 <p>The final result proves my first hypothesis (or rather expectation) that because 'think' shows 'mind' activity, it mostly appears at the climax of the story. And Voyant analysis proves so. What surprises me is that there is possibility that in one whole chapter, the author does not use this verb at all. All and all, voyant indeed reveals surprising facts that no readers ever expect when they read a piece of writing.</p>
