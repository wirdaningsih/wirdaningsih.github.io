<h3>Author's Corner</h3>

<p>Sir Arthur Conan Doyle is famous for his work in detective fiction. One of his famous works features Detective Sherlock Holmes as the main character. He wrote various novels and short stories featuring the detective.</p>

<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p> I have always been interested in suspense, detective stories. Moreover, Sherlock Holmes is one of my favorite fictional detective characters. I did not know what to reveal when I first chose this text. My one and only reason was because I like the series. Voyant helped me reveal some thing I did not even concern about when I read the series.</p>
 <p>In the beginning of my inquiry on Voyant I was really interested in finding out the most frequent word used by the main character in the story, Sherlock Holmes. However, I did not continue this analysis as I thought that it was almost impossible for me to do so considering the amount of energy needed to cut out the speech of other characters beside Holmes himself. However, it proves that it is not an impossible task. Indeed, that is the main reason why I am extending this project for my final, and focusing on this inquiry. In addition, a few minor changes were added to the old data to make the result better.</p>
 
<h3>About this project</h3>
<p>In this project, focusing on Doyle's detective literary works with Sherlock Holmes as the main character, four novels and three collections of his short stories were analyzed with Voyant tools.</p>
<ul ul style="list-style-type:circle">
<li>1887 A Study in Scarlet (Novel)</li>
<li>1890 The Sign of the Four (Novel)</li>
<li>1892 The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes (Short stories collection)</li>
<li>1893 The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes (Short stories collection)</li>
<li>1902 The Hound of the Baskervilles (Novel)</li>
<li>1905 The Return of Sherlock Holmes (Short stories collection)</li>
<li>1905 The Valley of Fear (Novel)</li>
</ul>

<p>My first inquiry about this project was I wanted to find out the most frequent word spoken by the main character, Sherlock Holmes, in all the series. However, with Voyant I could not really specify my search with this focus. Thus, instead of focusing on the main character only, I used this tool to find out the most frequent verbs used by the author in these series. I wanted to find out the most common action perfomed in his works.</p>

<p>The figure above shows the first result of my data search. However, there are some words which are irrelevant with my focus, so I listed five words shown in the cirrus (man, sir, mr, holmes, and watson) in the stopwords tool.</p>

<p>The word 'said' appears to be most frequent verb used, which is normal as in any other fiction. The verbs 'come' and its past form 'came' become the next most frequent verbs. I think this is also quite normal as in detective stories, charactes usually come and go from one scene to another. Based on the result, I become curious about the use of the word 'think' by the author in the work. Appearing in 676 contexts, theis verb caught my eyes. To think is the most common action performed by the characters in the stories after to come and to know. Why so? I then tried to see several contexts in which 'think' occured.</p>
 
 
<iframe style='width: 958px; height: 327px;' src='//voyant-tools.org/tool/Contexts/?stopList=keywords-409ec3619032a0ec2e600b93ae275a80&query=think&corpus=7a745c69a040302ae94dc6dd6a459340'></iframe>

<p>The word 'think' mostly appears in conversation context. The author used 'think' often in this detective fiction. As the stories involve various unsolved cases, the characters need to be able to read the situation and be critical to come up with the solution. Thus, the author's choice of using the word 'think' is very relevant.</p>
<p> In order to specifically analyze the occurrence of the verb 'think' in the story, I chose one novel of all the series.</p>
 <iframe style='width: 637px; height: 508px;' src='//voyant-tools.org/tool/Trends/?view=Contexts&stopList=keywords-409ec3619032a0ec2e600b93ae275a80&query=think&bins=62&corpus=7a745c69a040302ae94dc6dd6a459340'></iframe>
 <p>By looking at the trend chart, it can be seen that the verb 'think' most frequently appears in the 1892 The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes short story collection. Since I want to analyze in which part of the plot 'think' exists, I decided not to choose this collection as it comprises of several stories. Finally, I decided to choose the 1902 The Hound of Baskerville novel.</p>
<p>I separated the file based on the chapters in order to analyze the trend of the occurrence of the verb 'think'.</p>
<iframe style='width: 637px; height: 508px;' src='//voyant-tools.org/tool/Trends/?query=think*&bins=17&corpus=a4645e073f39abc882decbff9e599ca7'></iframe>
<p>To my surprise, the trend result shows that in Chapter 2 no verb 'think' appears, while it reaches the peak in Chapter 13.</p>
<p>I look back to chapter 2 of the novel and found out that this chapter tells readers about Sir Charles Baskerville. In this chapter, Conan Doyle gives this background story to support the mystery development. Chapter 13, on the other hand, is one crucial part of the story. In this climax part, Holmes starts making deduction. He starts to drop clues at various points throughout the story. </p>

 <p>In the link visualization image above, it can be seen how the verb think is connected to other words in the story. Verb think is almost always related to a proper noun, a name of a character in the story or a place.</p>
 

<iframe style='width: 637px; height: 508px;' src='//voyant-tools.org/tool/WordTree/?view=corpusset&query=think&corpus=a4645e073f39abc882decbff9e599ca7'></iframe>
 <iframe style='width: 628px; height: 893px;' src='//voyant-tools.org/tool/TermsBerry/?view=WordTree&query=think&corpus=a4645e073f39abc882decbff9e599ca7'></iframe>
 <p>In addition, the word tree map above shows the words preceeding and following 'think'. As an action verb, it is normal to see that subjects mostly appear before it. And interestingly, noun clauses using 'that' follow 'think' in many occurrences. This might show that think is used to preceed deduction made by the characters in the story. Also the term berry visualization helps show how the verb think (appears in green when we hover on it) is related to several other words (appear in pink).</p>
 
 
 

 <p>The final result proves my first hypothesis (or rather expectation) that because 'think' shows 'mind' activity, it mostly appears at the climax of the story. And Voyant analysis proves so. What surprises me is that there is possibility that in one whole chapter, the author does not use this verb at all. All and all, voyant indeed reveals surprising facts that no readers ever expect when they read a piece of writing.</p>
