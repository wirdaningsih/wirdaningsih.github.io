<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I am an Indonesian studying in the US. I am currently taking my master in TESOL at Indiana University of Pennsylvania. This is my second year and I expect to graduate this May. Before taking my master here, I was a high school teacher in Palembang, Indonesia. Coming from different country, equipped with my own social and cultural identity, I found it hard at first to live and study in the United States. But with the support of friends and professors here, I can manage to survive.</p>
